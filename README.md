This project focuses on analyzing stock market data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It involves detailed exploration of stock prices and trading volumes, prediction of future stock prices using Linear Regression, and analysis of market correlations between different stocks. Various visualizations like line plots for closing prices, daily returns, and stock performance comparisons are created to better understand stock behavior. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from the data, identify market trends, and build predictive models to assist in better decision-making for investors and financial analysts. This project emphasizes real-world application of data science skills.
